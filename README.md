1. Requirements and Goals: The CS360 Project 3 app developed in Android Studio aimed to create a user-friendly weight loss tracker. It was designed to address the user's need for a convenient way to monitor their daily weight and progress towards their weight loss goals.
2.Screens and Features: The necessary screens and features included:
  Login/Sign Up: To allow users to create accounts and securely log in.
  Main Dashboard: Displaying user's current weight, progress chart, and options to input daily weight entries.
  Weight Entry Form: A form to input daily weight entries with date selection.
  Settings: Options to customize the app's settings and profile.
  The UI designs kept users in mind by prioritizing simplicity, intuitive navigation, and clear presentation of weight-related data. The designs were successful     because they focused on the core functionality while minimizing complexity, making it easy for users to track their progress effectively.
3. Coding Approach: The app was coded using Java and followed a structured approach. Techniques included modular programming, separation of concerns, and adherence to coding best practices. These strategies could be applied in the future to ensure code maintainability, scalability, and readability.
4. Testing: Testing was conducted at various stages of development, including unit testing for individual components and integration testing for overall functionality. This process was important to identify and fix bugs, ensure the app's functionality, and deliver a smooth user experience. Testing revealed issues such as input validation errors and UI inconsistencies that were addressed promptly.
5. Innovation Challenges: One challenge faced during development was implementing a responsive and visually appealing chart to display weight progress. To overcome this, innovative solutions such as using third-party chart libraries and customizing chart appearance were explored, resulting in a visually appealing and informative chart component.
Demonstration of Knowledge and Skills: A particular component where knowledge, skills, and experience were demonstrated effectively was the implementation of user authentication and data storage using SQLite database. This involved designing secure login/signup functionality and managing user data securely, showcasing proficiency in both front-end and back-end development aspects.
